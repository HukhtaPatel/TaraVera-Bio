<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build and iteratively refine a professional, modern, and minimalist website for a biotech company called TaraVera Bio. The project started as a multi-section landing page, evolved into a multi-page site, and has now been consolidated back into a single-page application with smooth-scrolling navigation. The core focus is on a premium, investor-focused design that showcases the company's science, team, and vision.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Single-Page Architecture:** The entire website content (Home, Science, About Us, News) should exist on a single landing page, with a navigation bar that smoothly scrolls to the corresponding sections.
- **Modern UI/UX:**
    - A floating, pill-shaped navigation bar with a glassmorphism (frosted glass) effect.
    - Minimalist design with large typography, strategic use of whitespace, and a card-based modular layout.
    - Custom typography: Urbanist for headings and Manrope for body text.
    - Animated video backgrounds in hero sections.
    - Consistent and high-quality branding and iconography.
- **Content Sections:**
    - **Home:** Hero section, mission, and company overview.
    - **Science:** Detailed explanation of the company's scientific approach, biomarker strategy, and a Lead Programme section with a development pathway graphic.
    - **About Us:** Vision, values, management team profiles, and a Contact Us CTA.
    - **News:** Company formation announcement and vision.
- **Functionality:**
    - A functional light/dark mode toggle.
    - A Contact Us CTA that links to the company's email.
- **Content Source:** All website text content is based on user-provided documents. All imagery and media are provided by the user.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a complete, single-page React application. It features a modern, floating pill-shaped header with smooth-scroll navigation to different sections (, , , ) all within the main page. The design is minimalist and premium, incorporating a light/dark mode, custom fonts (Urbanist & Manrope), and animated video backgrounds. All content is currently hardcoded in the frontend components. The backend and database from the initial template remain unused.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent updated the site-wide logo. The new logo was applied to the header navigation bar and the footer to ensure brand consistency across all parts of the website.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:

        -   **Issue 1:** Verify logo update.
            -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent replaced the logo assets in  and updated the  attributes in  and .
            -   **Next debug checklist:** The user needs to visually confirm the change on the live preview.
            -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To ensure the website reflects the latest company branding.
            -   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P1: Contact Form Functionality:** The current Get in Touch CTA is a simple  link. This could be upgraded to a functional contact form that sends an email via a backend endpoint or stores inquiries in a database.
-   **P2: Interactive Enhancements:** Implement micro-interactions and animations suggested by the agent to improve user experience, such as:
    -   Scroll-triggered fade-in animations for sections.
    -   Making the Development Pathway graphic interactive with hover effects.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **P0: Full Backend Implementation:** The entire frontend is using hardcoded data. A backend needs to be developed to manage content dynamically. This would involve:
    -   Creating MongoDB models for different content sections (Science, Team, News, etc.).
    -   Building FastAPI endpoints to serve the content to the frontend.
    -   Refactoring the main page component () to fetch data from these new API endpoints instead of using hardcoded values.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Full Content & Structure Overhaul:** Replaced all website content based on new user requirements.
-   **Single-Page Application Conversion:** Refactored the architecture from a multi-page site to a single-page application using  for smooth navigation.
-   **UI/UX Redesign:**
    -   **Header:** Implemented a floating, pill-shaped navigation bar with a glassmorphism effect.
    -   **Home Page:** Redesigned with a minimalist, card-based layout and a full-screen video background.
    -   **Development Pathway:** Created and iteratively refined a custom, responsive SVG-based graphic for the development pipeline to match the site's aesthetic.
-   **Typography System:** Implemented a site-wide typography system using Urbanist for headings and Manrope for body text.
-   **Content Consolidation:** Merged the Programme page content into the Science section and updated navigation accordingly.
-   **Team & Contact:** Updated the About Us section with real team member profiles (including photos) and added a Contact Us section with a  CTA, removing individual contact details.
-   **Consistency Fixes:** Resolved issues with content repetition and ensured logo consistency across light/dark modes and different site sections.
-   **Documentation:** Created a comprehensive  file for the project.
-   **Logo Update:** Replaced the old site logo with a new one across the header and footer.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
There are no known issues that were mentioned and not fixed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** N/A
-   **Recurrence count:** 0

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
-   **Navigation:** Single-page smooth scrolling implemented using .
-   **State Management:** React Context API for theme management ().
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with dark mode variants. Custom CSS for animations and glassmorphism effects ().
-   **Icons:** .
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (template available but not used).
-   **Database:** MongoDB (template available but not used).

**key DB schema**
-   No database schemas have been created.

**changes in tech stack**
-   The project now effectively relies on the  library (or equivalent logic implemented by the agent) for its core single-page navigation functionality.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx**: The main and only page file, containing the aggregated content for all sections (Hero, Science, About Us, News).
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.jsx**: Implements the floating, pill-shaped navigation bar with smooth-scroll links and dynamic styling.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Footer.jsx**: The site footer, updated with new navigation and logo.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The root component, simplified to render only the  page.  was removed.
-   **/app/frontend/tailwind.config.js**: Updated with custom fonts (, ) and color palettes.
-   **/app/frontend/public/index.html**: Head section updated to import the new Google Fonts.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**: Contains global styles, font definitions, and custom utility classes for typography.
-   **/app/README.md**: New documentation file with project overview and setup instructions.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Data Hardcoding:** All website content is hardcoded directly into the  component. This is the most critical area for refactoring. The next major step should be to move this content to a backend API.
-   **Component Monolith:** The  file is very large. It should be broken down into smaller, more manageable components for each section (e.g., , ) to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   No new API endpoints have been created.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Single-Page Architecture:** The project is now a single-page application. Do not try to add new pages via routing. Instead, add new sections within  and update the  with a new  from .
-   **Iterative User:** The user provides very specific, visual, and iterative feedback. Expect to make many small design adjustments.
-   **Hardcoded Content:** All content is hardcoded. The next logical step is backend development to make the content dynamic, which is listed as a future task.
-   **Component Structure:** All page content resides in . It's a large file that should be refactored into smaller section-based components.
