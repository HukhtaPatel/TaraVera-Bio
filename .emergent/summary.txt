<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a professional, modern, and minimalist landing page for a biotech company called TaraVera Bio. The website should be investor-focused and showcase the company's science, technology, and team.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Modern, minimalist design with strategic color accents and innovative interactions.
- Sections for Hero, Scientific Approach, Technology Platform, Team, Investment Opportunity, and a Call-to-Action (CTA).
- Use professional imagery, particularly highlighting women in science.
- Implement a dark mode feature.
- Include a subtle, biotech-themed animated background.
- Ensure the company name TaraVera Bio is reflected in the browser tab title.
- The content should be strictly based on documents provided by the user.
- The pre-seed funding information needs to be detailed and accurate as per user's updates.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete, frontend-only, single-page React application for TaraVera Bio has been built. The site is fully responsive, features a light/dark mode, and includes a custom animated background. All sections requested by the user are present with hardcoded content derived from user-provided documents. The backend and database from the initial template are untouched.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested to simplify the website's background animations. The agent removed the binary data streams from the custom animated background and also removed the video that was previously added to the Hero section.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending or in-progress issues. The agent has completed all user requests up to this point.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Future Tasks:**
- **P0: Full Backend Implementation:** The entire frontend is currently using hardcoded data. A backend needs to be developed to manage content dynamically. This would likely involve:
    - Creating MongoDB models for different content sections.
    - Building FastAPI endpoints to serve the content to the frontend.
    - Refactoring all frontend components (, , , etc.) to fetch data from these new API endpoints instead of using hardcoded values.
- **P1: Contact Form Functionality:** The Partner with us CTA could be enhanced with a functional contact form that sends an email or stores inquiries in the database. This would require both frontend form implementation and a backend endpoint to process the submissions.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Landing Page Creation:** Built a complete, multi-section landing page with the following components: , , , , , , , and .
- **Dark Mode Implementation:** Added a theme context () and a toggle switch () to enable a site-wide dark mode. All components were updated to support both themes.
- **Content and Branding Updates:** Iteratively updated website content, logos, and imagery based on user-provided documents and feedback. This included updating the browser tab title in .
- **Custom Animated Background:** Created and repeatedly refined a complex animated background in  to match the user's vision of a bioinformatics/data processing theme.
- **Image & Video Management:** Added, updated, and removed images and a video background in the Hero and Team sections as per user requests.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
There are no known issues that were mentioned and not fixed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** N/A
-   **Recurrence count:** 0
-   **Status:** N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
-   **State Management:** React Context API for theme management.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with dark mode variants (). Custom CSS animations for the background.
-   **Icons:** .
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (template available but not used).
-   **Database:** MongoDB (template available but not used).

**key DB schema**
- No new database schemas have been created. The default  collection from the boilerplate exists but is not in use.

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes were made to the core technology stack.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main entry point for the React application, which composes all the page sections.
-   **/app/frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx**: Manages the light/dark mode state for the entire application.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/BiotechBackground.jsx**: A custom component rendering a complex, animated background that has been modified multiple times based on user feedback.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.jsx**: Contains the logo (with dynamic switching for dark mode) and the theme toggle button.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx**: The main landing section.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Team.jsx**: Updated with female-focused imagery as requested.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Investment.jsx**: Updated with detailed pre-seed funding information.
-   **/app/frontend/public/index.html**: Title and meta tags were updated for branding.
-   **/app/frontend/App.css**: Contains keyframe animations for the custom background.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Data Hardcoding:** All content across all components is currently hardcoded. This should be refactored to fetch data from a backend API once it's built.
-   **BiotechBackground.jsx:** This component is complex and has a lot of hardcoded magic numbers for the animation. It could be refactored for better performance and readability.

**key api endpoints**
-   No new API endpoints have been created. The default endpoints from the FastAPI template ( and ) are present but unused.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user is highly iterative and provides specific, visual feedback. Expect multiple small changes to design, content, and imagery.
- The entire application is frontend-only. All data is mocked/hardcoded. The next logical step is backend development, but you should wait for the user to request it.
- The custom animated background in  is a key feature that has been refined extensively. Be cautious with any changes to this file.
- Dark mode is a core feature. Ensure any new components or changes are compatible with both light and dark themes.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has successfully executed all user requests so far. The larger task of backend implementation has not been forgotten but rather not yet requested by the user, which aligns with the iterative development process.</analysis>
